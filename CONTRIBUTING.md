# How to contribute to Kurento

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching in our [GitHub bugtracker](https://github.com/Kurento/bugtracker/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Kurento/bugtracker/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/support.html#reporting-issues).



## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Before submitting, please read the [Contribution Guide](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project/contribute.html).

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.



## **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Kurento will generally not be accepted.



## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [Kurento Public Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kurento) before start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.



## **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Kurento in the [Kurento Public Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kurento).

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kurento?sort=frequent) might also be a valuable resource.



## **Do you want to contribute to Kurento documentation?**

* Follow the same steps as indicated for contributing features and bug fixes. Start by reading the [Contribution Guide](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project/contribute.html).
