# How to get help

If you are facing an issue with Kurento Media Server, follow this basic check list:

* **Step 1**: Test with the **latest version** of Kurento Media Server. Follow the installation instructions here: [Installation Guide](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html).

* **Step 2**: If the problem still happens in the latest version, and the Kurento developers are already tracking progress for a solution in a bug report or a support contract, you may test the latest (unreleased) changes by installing a nightly version of KMS: [Installing Nightly Builds](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation_dev.html).

* **Step 3**: When your issue exists in both the latest and nightly versions, try resorting to the [Open-Source Community](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/support.html#support-community). Kurento users might be having the same issue and maybe you can find help in there.

* **Step 4**: If you want full attention from the Kurento team, get in contact with us to request [Commercial Support](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/support.html#support-commercial).

For more information about how to request support, and how to submit bug reports and commercial enquiries, have a look at the full [Support](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/support.html) page in the Kurento documentation.
